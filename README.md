<h1>File organizer</h1>

It's a small program I built in Python that moves files from your Downloads folder to the appropriate folder (A video will be moved to videos, a pictures will be moved to images,etc)

I created this project to learn how to code in Python and also to organize my Downloads folder because it was kinda messy :)

Feel free to clone it on your computer and play around with it.

<h3> <b> The program might not work properly at first because the destination folders are different on your computer, you either need to create ```videos```, ```audios```, ```documents``` and ```images``` folders inside your Documents folder in order for the program to work. </b> </h3>
